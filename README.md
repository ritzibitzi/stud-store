### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they were very helpful, alongside the videos. There's a lot to keep track of but I'm starting to get it.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have invested more time in learning about routes and links than in the front end, and I would have changed the layout of the pop up page, and clean up the css on my site.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was in the middle of debugging so I had to make do with my preloaded localhost windows, but it went okay. I noticed they focused on the backend more than the frontend, and that inspired me to shift gears.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
